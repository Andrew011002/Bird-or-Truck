# Is it a bird or a truck?

Using the CIFAR-10 Dataset, I built a Convolutional Neural Network that tries to accuractely classify an image as a airplane, automobile, bird, cat				deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck

## Installation

Open your terminal, then copy & paste the command in your desired directory location

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andrew011002/Bird-or-Truck.git
```

## Running
Drop your image(s) that you'd like to classify into the images file directory and run the prediction.py file to see the results of your image(s)
